Task 1: Dynamic Integer Array with Sum Calculation


This program dynamically allocates memory for an array of integers using malloc(). The user inputs the number of elements and their respective values. The program then calculates and prints the sum of the integers, freeing the memory after use.

Task 2: Using calloc for Initialized Array with Average Calculation


This program uses calloc() to allocate memory for an array of integers initialized to zero. The user inputs values, and the program calculates the average, prints the initial and updated arrays, and frees the memory.

Task 3: Resizing an Array Using realloc with Memory Shrinking


This program allocates memory for 10 integers, allows the user to input 10 values, and then shrinks the array to hold only 5 integers using realloc(). It prints the first 5 values and frees the memory.


Task 4: Dynamic String Array with realloc


This program dynamically allocates memory for an array of strings (char pointers), allows the user to input 3 strings, then resizes the array using realloc() to accommodate 2 more strings. It prints all strings and frees the memory.


Task 5: Dynamic Memory for Student Grades

This program allocates memory for student grades using malloc(), takes input from the user, and calculates the highest and lowest grades. The memory is freed after use.
